# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

> WAY more confident now. I had a critical misunderstanding about how I was supposed to pass arguments through.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

> Very confident now

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

> Do methods take longer to process than just typing out the code yourself?
